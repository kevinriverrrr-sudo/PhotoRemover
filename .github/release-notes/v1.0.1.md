# Release v1.0.1 - Deployment Fix 🔧

## 🐞 Critical Bug Fix

This release fixes a critical deployment issue that prevented the application from building on Vercel and other cloud platforms.

### Problem

The initial release (v1.0.0) had dependency conflicts that caused build failures:

```
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree

```

### Solution

✅ **Fixed React Three Fiber and Drei dependency versions**
- Updated `@react-three/fiber` from `^8.18.5` to `^8.17.10`
- Updated `@react-three/drei` from `^9.119.2` to `^9.114.3`
- Pinned `three` to `^0.170.0` for consistency
- Updated all other dependencies to stable, compatible versions

### Deployment Status

✅ **Now successfully deploys on:**
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Docker
- Custom servers
